This is the GitHub Repository for the paper: "Real-Time ECG Analysis with the Ardmob-ECG: A Comparative Assessment" that has been published as a book chapter in IEEE SPMB in Springer Nature in 2023. The bookchapter can be accessed under the following link: (TODO). The abstract of the chapter is given below: 

This bookchapter validates the performance of the "ArdMob-ECG". The "ArdMob-ECG" is a low-cost (10-100 USD),
easy to assemble and use, small, lightweight, mobile, and Arduino based ECG device that can be used for a variety
of medical and scientific applications. However, as of yet, only little validation has been done on this relatively new
device. This chapter validates the performance of the ArdMob-ECG by assessing its usability, validity, and reliability,
and compares it to a state-of-the-art ECG in two use cases: measuring the accuracy of the ArdMob-ECG in detecting
inter-beat intervals, and measuring the latency of the ArdMob-ECG in online detection of R-peaks. Additionally, the
empirical latencies of an Arduino-Unity-Arduino interface has been assessed and is described in this chapter.
Overall the performance, time delays, and frequency domain analyses of the ArdMob-ECG is strikingly similar
to state of the art machines, which make the ArdMob-ECG a practical and qualitative tool for scientific uses
